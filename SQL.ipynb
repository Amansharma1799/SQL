        "- **NOT NULL** → Ensures a column cannot have NULL values.  \n",
        "- **UNIQUE** → Ensures column values are unique.  \n",
        "- **PRIMARY KEY** → Uniquely identifies a row (combination of NOT NULL + UNIQUE).  \n",
        "- **CHECK** → Enforces a condition (e.g., age must be 18 or above).  \n",
